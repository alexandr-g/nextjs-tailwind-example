# A minimalist NextJS + TailwindCSS example setup

An example uses a minimum setup for [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) in combination with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling. You can clone or fork a repository to play around or use it for your needs.

## Available Scripts

In the project root directory, you can run:

- `npm run dev` - runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

- `npm run build` - builds the app for production.

- `npm start` - serves `npm run build` output on the `http://localhost:3000`
